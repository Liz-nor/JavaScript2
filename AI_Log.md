Date: 17.feb
Purpose: Asking about the pros and cons to using a modal for logging in because the way I had structured my page was where the front page is the first to come up.
Outcome: Made it clear that it would be a good choice for content that is private, premium based, relying on personalization. Also gave alternatives as being able to scroll some down the page before needing to login or needing to log in as soon as you click on something. Because of time restriction, the fact that the MPA structure was already done and I dont feel comfortable with making these changes I opted a last resort which was not showing content before having logged in.
